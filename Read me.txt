How It Works
In 3‑phase mode:
Only one (large) circle is drawn at the center (with a 150‑unit scale) showing the combined phase vectors (A, B, C) and the resultant R (displayed as “A + B + C = R”).

In 6‑phase mode:
Three separate circles (each with scale factor 80) are drawn vertically:

The star circle (top) shows only the star phases (A, B, C).
The combined circle (middle) shows both the star and delta phases (A, a, B, b, C, c) and computes the resultant R. A trail is drawn for R (using a new random color each time the trail is cleared).
The delta circle (bottom) shows only the delta phases (a, b, c) which are defined with a 120° offset relative to their corresponding star phase.
Interactivity:
• Space bar or left click (inside a circle) toggles freeze/unfreeze.
• Middle click acts as “step” when frozen or swaps rotation when running.
• Mouse wheel adjusts speed.
• Double click (or the on–screen button) toggles between 3‑phase and 6‑phase modes.
• The “Toggle Trail” button turns the combined trail on or off.
